# Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Robotics

This chapter will cover the fundamental concepts of robotics, including:

*   **Kinematics:** The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. We will explore both forward and inverse kinematics, which are essential for controlling the movement of robotic arms and legs.
*   **Dynamics:** The study of motion while considering the forces that cause it. We will delve into the dynamics of robotic systems, including the effects of gravity, friction, and inertia.
*   **Control Systems:** The "brains" of a robot. We will discuss different types of control systems, from simple PID controllers to more advanced adaptive and learning-based controllers.
*   **Sensors and Actuators:** The "senses" and "muscles" of a robot. We will cover a wide range of sensors, including cameras, lidar, and IMUs, as well as different types of actuators, such as motors and servos.
