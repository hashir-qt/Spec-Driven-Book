# Chapter 2: The Fundamentals of AI

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that are relevant to robotics, including:

*   **Machine Learning:** We will explore the core principles of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We will also discuss how these techniques can be used to enable robots to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
*   **Deep Learning:** We will delve into the world of deep learning and neural networks. We will cover the basics of building and training deep learning models, and we will explore how they can be used for tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
*   **Computer Vision:** We will discuss how robots "see" the world. We will cover topics such as image processing, feature detection, and object recognition, and we will explore how these techniques can be used to enable robots to navigate their environment and interact with objects.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** We will explore how robots can understand and generate human language. We will cover topics such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots, and we will discuss how these techniques can be used to enable robots to communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.
