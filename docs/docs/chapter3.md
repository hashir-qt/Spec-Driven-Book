# Chapter 3: Humanoid Design and Locomotion

This chapter will focus on the unique challenges and opportunities of humanoid robotics. We will cover:

*   **Bipedal Locomotion:** The science and engineering of walking on two legs. We will explore the challenges of balance and stability, and we will discuss different approaches to achieving a natural and efficient gait.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** How humans and humanoid robots can work together safely and effectively. We will cover topics such as social robotics, trust, and ethics.
*   **Manipulation and Grasping:** How humanoid robots can interact with and manipulate objects in their environment. We will discuss the design of robotic hands and the challenges of grasping and dexterity.
*   **Case Studies:** We will explore a variety of real-world humanoid robots, from research platforms to commercial products. We will analyze their design, capabilities, and limitations, and we will discuss the lessons learned from their development.
